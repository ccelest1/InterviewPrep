"""
The lowest common ancestor is the lowest node in the tree that has both n1 and n2 as descendants, where n1 and n2 are the nodes for which we wish to find the LCA. Hence, the LCA of a binary tree with nodes n1 and n2 is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.

   /  \
  2     3
 / \   / \
4  5  6   7

Path from root to 5 = { 1, 2, 5 }
Path from root to 6 = { 1, 3, 6 }

We start checking from 0 index. As both of the value matches( pathA[0] = pathB[0] ), we move to the next index.
pathA[1] not equals to pathB[1], thereâ€™s a mismatch so we consider the previous value.
Therefore the LCA of (5,6) = 1

input: list[int] that represent the hiearchy relative to a particular root/node
output: LCA, int that is the value of the LCA of Binary Tree
BST
Assume that lists are not always going to be same length, lists are going to have values

Node class, Tree class, find LCA function
node: value, parent, left, right
Tree [ contain nodes ]
LCA -> takes in two values, then we have to find where that value occurs in tree -> understand each individual paths from root or traverse and find node where they diverge/share
